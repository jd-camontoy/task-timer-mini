# Task Timer Mini

A simple Pomodoro-based timer that promotes productivity by providing a countdown to where the user is encouraged to focus on a task with the given period.

Used simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) for the page art.
